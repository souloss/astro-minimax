description: Built-in dynamic OG image generation using Satori, automatically creating social share images at build time.
---

astro-minimax includes built-in dynamic OG image generation. Articles without a specified `ogImage` get one auto-generated at build time.

## Intro

OG images (aka Social Images) play an important role in social media engagements. In case you don't know what OG image means, it is an image displayed whenever we share our website URL on social media such as Facebook, Discord etc.

> The Social Image used for Twitter is technically not called OG image. However, in this post, I'll be using the term OG image for all types of Social Images.

## Default/Static OG image (the old way)

astro-minimax already provided a way to add an OG image to a blog post. The author can specify the OG image in the frontmatter `ogImage`. Even when the author doesn't define the OG image in the frontmatter, the default OG image will be used as a fallback (in this case `public/astro-minimax-og.jpg`). But the problem is that the default OG image is static, which means every blog post that does not include an OG image in the frontmatter will always use the same default OG image despite each post title/content being different from others.

## Dynamic OG Image

Generating a dynamic OG image for each post allows the author to avoid specifying an OG image for every single blog post. Besides, this will prevent the fallback OG image from being identical to all blog posts.

astro-minimax uses Vercel's [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) package for dynamic OG image generation.

Dynamic OG images will be generated at build time for blog posts that

- don't include OG image in the frontmatter
- are not marked as draft.

## Anatomy of astro-minimax dynamic OG image

Dynamic OG image of astro-minimax includes _the blog post title_, _author name_ and _site title_. Author name and site title will be retrieved via `SITE.author` and `SITE.title` of **"src/config.ts"** file. The title is generated from the blog post frontmatter `title`.

### Issue Non-Latin Characters

Titles with non-latin characters won't display properly out of the box. To resolve this, we have to replace `fontsConfig` inside `loadGoogleFont.ts` with your preferred font.

```ts file=src/utils/loadGoogleFont.ts
async function loadGoogleFonts(
  text: string
): Promise<
  Array<{ name: string; data: ArrayBuffer; weight: number; style: string }>
> {
  const fontsConfig = [
    {
      name: "Noto Sans JP",
      font: "Noto+Sans+JP",
      weight: 400,
      style: "normal",
    },
    {
      name: "Noto Sans JP",
      font: "Noto+Sans+JP:wght@700",
      weight: 700,
      style: "normal",
    },
    { name: "Noto Sans", font: "Noto+Sans", weight: 400, style: "normal" },
    {
      name: "Noto Sans",
      font: "Noto+Sans:wght@700",
      weight: 700,
      style: "normal",
    },
  ];
  // ...
}
```

## Trade-off

While this is a nice feature to have, there's a trade-off. Each OG image takes roughly one second to generate. This might not be noticeable at first, but as the number of blog posts grows, you might want to disable this feature. Since every OG image takes time to generate, having many of them will increase the build time linearly.

For example: If one OG image takes one second to generate, then 60 images will take around one minute, and 600 images will take approximately 10 minutes. This can significantly impact build times as your content scales.

## Limitations

At the time of writing this, [Satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori) is fairly new and has not reached major release yet. So, there are still some limitations to this dynamic OG image feature.

- Besides, RTL languages are not supported yet.
- [Using emoji](https://github.com/vercel/satori#emojis) in the title might be a little bit tricky.
