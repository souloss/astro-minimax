## [0.8.3] - 2026-03-21

- **Floating Series Navigation**: New `FloatingSeriesNav` component that displays series progress and navigation for posts within a series. Shows progress bar and quick links to other posts in the same series.
- **PostMeta Component**: Unified post metadata display component for consistent presentation across card layouts, list views, and article pages.
- **Preferences Module**: Centralized user preferences management system inspired by Vben Admin. Includes theme presets, storage persistence, and share URL functionality.
- **Enhanced i18n**: Improved internationalization with centralized translation handling via the `i18n.ts` utility. Settings panel now supports dynamic language switching.
- **Statistics Overview**: Added stats sections to archives, categories, series, tags, and friends pages showing total counts.

### Changed

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

- **Mermaid theme adaptation**: Fixed Mermaid diagrams not updating colors when switching between light/dark themes. Diagrams now properly re-render with correct color schemes on theme change.
- **Cloudflare Pages deployment**: Resolved top-level await issue in `functions/api/chat.ts` that caused build failures. Vector index loading is now lazy-loaded on first request.
- **OG image URL path**: Fixed incorrect OG image URL path (`/posts/SLUG/index.png` → `/posts/SLUG.png`) that caused 404 errors when copying share images.
- **OG image QR code URL**: Fixed QR code URLs in dynamically generated OG images to use correct post paths (`/zh/posts/SLUG` instead of file path).
- **Documentation links**: Fixed broken links to color customization documentation throughout the codebase.

### Changed

- Removed misleading "dual version support" phrasing from documentation. Project now consistently uses "Astro v6" terminology.
- Removed `ogImage` fields from several blog posts to enable dynamic OG image generation with QR codes.
